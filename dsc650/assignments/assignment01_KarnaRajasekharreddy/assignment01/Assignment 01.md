#####a. Notes: Data Sizes
- 1024x768 PNG image: PNG file sizes are variable based upon color depth, alpha channel, and compression. I derived the 1.2MB above by sampling five random landscape images. Each was imported into GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) and sized to 1024 x 768 pixels. Each file was saved as a PNG with 1.2MB being the averaged filesize.
- 128 character message: Using a text editor, I generated a 128 character message and saved the file in ANSI, UTF-8 and UTF-16 formats. ANSI & UTF-8 used 128 bytes while UTF-16 used 256 bytes.

   PNG file size is dependent on color type (indexed, greyscale, truecolor) and an alpha channel is included. Uncompressed PNGs filesizes can vary between 1 bit and 16 bits per color channel, and can vary between 1 to 4 channels depending on the color type.

   -> TrueColor + Alpha Channel: 64 bits * 4 Channels * 756,432 pixels = 25,165,824 bytes
   -> Indexed Color with 1 bit color, 1 channel: 1bit * 1 channel * 756,432 pixels = 756,432 bytes
- 1024x768 RAW image: Assuming 3x 8bit color channels: 18,154,368 bytes
- 4K UHD HEVC Video (15 minutes): 900 seconds @ 10 Mbs: Based on Handbrake x.265 Encoding at Medium Preset.
- 4k UHD Uncompressed Video (15 minutes): (3840 × 2160): 8,294,400 Pixels * 24bits Color * 30fps * 900 secs = 5,374,771,200,000 bytes
- Human Genome (Uncompressed): The completed sequence would ideally be 700MB to account for the 3billion character sequence. 200GB is required as part of the actual sequencing process.
- HD (1080p) HEVC Video (15 minutes): 900 seconds @ 3.27 Mb/s: Based on Handbrake x.265 Encoding at Medium Preset.
- HD (1080p) Uncompressed Video (15 minutes): 1080p (1920x1080): 2,073,600 Pixels * 24bits Color * 30fps * 900 secs = 1,343,692,800,000 bytes

#####b. Notes: Scaling
- Daily Twitter Tweets (Snappy Compressed): Snappy Compression multiplies Plaint Text filesize by 1.5x to 1.7x (accoriding to the Github Snappy Page). A multiplier of 1.6 was applied. 128b * 500,000,000 * 1.6
- Daily Instagram Photos: 1.2MB PNG * 75,000,000
- Daily Twitter Tweets (Uncompressed): 128b * 500,000,000
- Daily YouTube Videos Ideal Youtube Bitrate is 8Mbps (1MBps) for 1080p Video with x.264 Compression. 1440 Minutes per day * 1,800,000 seconds of Video Uploaded per minute * 1MBps = 2,592,000,000 MB or 2.5 PB / day. Hadoop Storage Requirement: (2,592 * 3 TB) / 10 TB = 777 10TB Drives
- Yearly Instagram Photos: 90TB * 365 = (32,850 TB * 3) / 10 TB Drives = 9,855 * 10TB Drives
- Yearly YouTube Videos: 2,592TB * 365 = 946 PB; 777 Drives * 365
- Yearly Twitter Tweets (Uncompressed): 62,500 * 365 = 22,812,500MB or Storage Calc: (22.81TB * 3) / 10TB Drives = 6.8 * 10 TB Drives.
- Yearly Twitter Tweets (Snappy Compressed): 22,812,500 * 1.6 Storage; (36.5TB * 3) / 10 = 10.95 (11 * 10TB Drives)

#####d. Notes: Latency
- Los Angeles to Amsterdam: The straight line distance is 3912.32 km. Latency varies by a variety on conditions. But it could be absolutely no less than 13.04ms (3912.32km / 299,792km/s) = .01304 seconds.
- Low Earth Orbit Satellite: Low earth orbit defined by Mirriam Webster is 140 to 970 kilometers. [ 140km / 299,792 km/s ] = 466 μs, [ 970km / 299,792 km/s ] = 3ms
- Earth to Mars: The distance to Mars from Earth varies between 55.76 Million km & 400.2 Million km. [55,760,000km / 299,792 km/s] = 3.09 Minutes; [ 400,200,000km / 299,792 km/s ] = 22.2 minutes
- All electro magnetic radiation moves at the speed of light, which is 299, 792, 458 m/s.
- Earth to the Moon: The moon has an elliptical orbit with daily varying apogee and perigee. On December 4th 2021 the moon's distance from my hometown will vary between 356,794km & 406,320km. [356,794km / 299,792 km/s] = 1.19s [ 406,320km / 299,792 km/s] = 1.35s
- Geostationary Satellite: Equatorial Geostationary orbit is 35,786km. [35,786km / 299,792 km/s ] = 119ms

#####c. Notes: Reliability
- Current Blackblaze Annualized Failure Rate: .011
